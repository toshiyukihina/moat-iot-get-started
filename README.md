MOAT IoT Application Example
===
This is an example application using MOAT IoT API set.

The application is composed of 4 parts:

 1. An Android project using [MOAT Java](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-java-api-document)
 2. Server side Javascripts using [MOAT js](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-js-api-document)
 3. Rails application using [MOAT REST](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-rest-api-document)
 4. Google App Engine application using [MOAT REST](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-rest-api-document)

For users who aren't familiar with Rails or are using Windows OS, please choose Google App Engine application.

You need to sign up Inventit IoT Developer Network Sandbox Server with [IIDN Command Line Tool](https://github.com/inventit/iidn-cli) in order to deploy the application.

## Get Started

See [the tutorial](http://dev.yourinventit.com/guides/get-started) to learn more.

## Setup Helper

As of 1.0.8, a setup helper script is included, which helps you to prepare building environment.

After signing up to IIDN, on the root of this project (same as where this README.md is) enter:

    moat-iot-get-started:$ rake

After a couple of minutes, the script will be terminated. And you need to run a few commands regarding signing secure token. The detailed commands are shown on the script log message. You can copy and paste the commands to run.
